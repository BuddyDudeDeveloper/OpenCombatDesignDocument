\chapter{Revenue}

\section{Donations}

\paragraph{} As a free and open-source community-driven game, the primary revenue source for OpenCombat will be sustained or singular donations through platforms such as [Patreon][patreon-link]. Current revenue models, such as pay-to-play and in-game purchases, often require players to make repeated or costly financial commitments in order to maintain enjoyment, consistency or access to the experience. Community-funding mitigates this issue at the expense of short-term revenue.

\section{Merchandising}

\paragraph{} The intellectual property of the game can be utilized to generate additional revenue through sales of clothing, figurines and other merchandise. As the game for the community grows, the cultural aspects (such as memes or jokes) can be applied to the merchandising. The game's soundtrack can be available on Bandcamp.

\section{Community eSports Drives}

During large eSports events for platform fighting games, such as Genesis and EVO, donation drives can be launched to encourage players to contribute. At these events, the donations can also serve as a way of increasing the prize pool for participants.
